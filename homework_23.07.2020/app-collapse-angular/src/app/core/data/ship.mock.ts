It possessed the greatest deadweight tonnage ever recorded. Fully loaded, its displacement was 657,019 tonnes.\n' +

  'The heaviest ship of any kind, and with a laden draft of 24.6 m (81 ft), it was incapable of navigating the English Channel, the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Overall, it is generally considered the largest ship ever built. Her engines were powered by the Ljungström turbine technology.\n' +

  'It was sunk during the Iran–Iraq War, but was later salvaged and restored to service. The vessel was converted to a floating storage and offloading unit (FSO) in 2004, moored off the coast of Qatar in the Persian Gulf at the Al Shaheen Oil Field.'
