  description: 'The BelAz 75710 has a conventional two-axle setup but the wheels are doubled, four to an axle, like a scaled-up International Payhauler 350. For this reason it needs eight 59/80R63 tires. It also has four-wheel drive and four-wheel hydraulic steering which is unusual. It has a turning radius of about 20 m (66 ft).\n' +

  'The 75710 can carry a 450-tonne (440-long-ton; 500-short-ton) load. With an empty weight of 450 tonnes (440 long tons; 500 short tons), it is much more heavily built than the previous model, which weighed 240 tonnes (240 long tons; 260 short tons) when empty. It is 20.6 m (67 ft 7 in) long, 8.16 m (26 ft 9 1⁄4 in) high, and 9.87 m (32 ft 4 5⁄8 in) wide. The bed is relatively shallow, limiting the volume of material that can be carried.\n' +

  'Instead of a single engine, the Siemens MMT 500 drive system is powered by two MTU 65-litre (4,000 cu in) 16-cylinder four stroke diesel engines, each with 2,300 horsepower (1,700 kW). These are coupled to two AC alternators and four AC traction motors (two in each axle. Fuel consumption (according to company data) is 198 g/kWh (1.94 oz/MJ) per engine, with option to run on only one if carrying less than capacity loads. Maximum speed is 64 km/h (40 mph), and economy maximum speed (when fully loaded and on a 10% gradient) is 40 km/h (25 mph)'
